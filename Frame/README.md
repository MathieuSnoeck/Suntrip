Freewheels
----------

Current freewheels are of the brand [Dicta](http://www.dicta.com.tw/), according to most reviews they basically suck.

Auguste ordered new ones from White Industries, the ENO freewheel but optimized for durability and rough use as can be found on sickbikeparts "heavy-duty front freewheel". On the White Industries website:


> Traditionally, freewheels have been considered a disposable component and one that should be replaced on a regular basis. It is our belief that when you invest in your drivetrain you should expect your gearing to be of sufficient quality and durability to allow more time for riding and less for repairing and replacing components.  We set out to create and manufacture a freewheel that would be durable, reliable, and easily maintained.
