# Transmission

Derailleur system
-----------------

This system seems to have the most advantages, not surprisingly since everybody in the professional race circuit uses this. Derailleur system should be well maintained in order to achieve high efficiency. 

| Transmission Type     | Average efficiency at 150 W |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Derailleurs           | 93 - 95 %                   |
| 3 speed Gear Hubs     | 92 - 95 %                   |
| 7 & 14 speed Gear Hubs| 89 - 91 %                   |

> Efficiency testing of bicycle gearing systems is complicated by a number of factors - in particular, all systems tend to be better at higher power rates. 200 Watts will drive a typical bicycle at 20 mph, while athletes can achieve 400W, at which point efficiencies 'approaching 98%' are claimed.

Pinion
------

From their website:

> Thus the efficiency of a Pinion transmission is between a high-quality hub transmission and a new chain shifter running absolutely straight from front to back. If a chain shifter is dirty and skewed, the efficiency of Pinion is better.

-------

Max. efficiency comparable with derailleur system

Nuvinci
-------

Nothing known about efficiency, company seems not to share this information.
