Solid tyres (#I don't want a flat on the rear wheel)
----------------------------------------------------

Solid tyres have a higher rolling resistance but never go flat and are lightweight, the have a life expectancy of 8000 km according to brand [Tannus](https://tannusamerica.com/). A [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIvDEdxg-b4) shows it's worn out at around 2500 km, however a user's comment contradict this. [Greentyre](http://www.greentyre.com/bicycle-tyres.php) also sells solid tyres but yet again I find [dissatisfied costumers](https://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/75/article18.html). Then there is another much more recent player on the market, [Nexo tires](https://www.nexotire.com), yet again I don't seem to find good reviews.

Tubeless tyres
--------------

Schwalbe believes this is **the technology**, from their website:

> Tubeless tires provide clear advantages in speed, comfort, grip and puncture protection. They avoid unnecessary friction between tires and tubes, which reduces the rolling resistance even more than with super light competition tires.  Tubeless tires can be used with a lower inflation pressure without compromising performance. That brings clear advantages in comfort as well as clearly more control in critical situations and on bad surface trails. At the same time, tubeless systems provide a high puncture protection. The danger of blowouts is clearly reduced. A sudden loss of air pressure by burst tubes or valve tear off is excluded. What is more, tubeless systems function perfectly together with puncture protection liquids. Punctures are re-sealed within milliseconds.  

However, they do not have the equivalent of the marathon plus protection (rated the maximum score of 7) in the tubeless category.

Clinchers tyres
---------------

Seems like [Schwalbe marathon plus](https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tour-reader/marathon-plus.html) tires seem the way to go. Mileage for the marathon tyres (not the marathon plus) seems to be in between 6000-12000 km.

[Continental touring plus](http://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle/tyres/city-trekking-tyres/touring-plus) doesn't sell in 20" format, as with Vredestein and Maxxis (although Maxxis has the creepy crawler but that just doesn't look like it).
