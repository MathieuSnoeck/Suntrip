Solid tyres (#I don't want a flat on the rear wheel)
----------------------------------------------------

Solid tyres have a higher rolling resistance but never go flat and are lightweight, the have a life expectancy of 8000 km according to brand [Tannus](https://tannusamerica.com/). A [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIvDEdxg-b4) shows it's worn out at around 2500 km, however a user's comment contradict this. [Greentyre](http://www.greentyre.com/bicycle-tyres.php) also sells solid tyres but yet again I find [dissatisfied costumers](https://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/75/article18.html). Then there is another much more recent player on the market, [Nexo tires](https://www.nexotire.com), yet again I don't seem to find good reviews.

Seems like [Schwalbe marathon plus](https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tour-reader/marathon-plus.html) tires seem the way to go. Mileage for the marathon tyres (not the marathon plus) seems to be in between 6000-12000 km.
