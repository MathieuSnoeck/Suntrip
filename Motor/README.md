### BMC V2, V3, V4

High end geared hub motors. 600w overvolting capacity to 2500 watts. The BMC is a larger (8lb) geared hub motor, designed to be more efficient and have a better power-to-weight ratio than a gearless (direct-drive) motor.  (Read our [review](https://www.electricbike.com/bmc-hub-motor-review/) here)

### MAC Motor (BMC clone)

Very similar to the BMC but not as high quality, so cannot withstand high power and have the same reliability as the BMC.
