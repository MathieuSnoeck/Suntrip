For the moment I'm only looking at efficiency curves. I mention peak efficiency followed by an indication of sensitivity by mentioning the RPM range for which the efficiency > 80%.
Wheel size = 20"

Hub motors
----------

### Grin All-Axle

87.9% [333.4 - 485.9] [80.0 - 80.5] a range of 152.5 RPM

### Grin Hub

Same motor

### 9C+ 2705

87.9% [387.6 - 579.7] [80.0 - 80.6] a range of 192.1 RPM

Other 9C+ motors have less performance

### Mac 10T


### 


### BMC V2, V3, V4

High end geared hub motors. 600w overvolting capacity to 2500 watts. The BMC is a larger (8lb) geared hub motor, designed to be more efficient and have a better power-to-weight ratio than a gearless (direct-drive) motor.  (Read our [review](https://www.electricbike.com/bmc-hub-motor-review/) here)

### MAC Motor (BMC clone)

Very similar to the BMC but not as high quality, so cannot withstand high power and have the same reliability as the BMC.

### Dapu Hub Motor

A new hub motor used on production bikes such as the Neo Jumper and City Commuter. It is small, wide, and puts out a maximum of 750 watts.

### Crystalyte ( HS35 /  HT35)

A recently released direct drive motor weighing in at 16 pounds (Read our [review](https://www.electricbike.com/crystalyte-hub-motor/) here)

### Cute Motor

A small planetary geared motor. 5 lbs, and capable of running 800 watts. Figure around 20mph top speed on a cute powered E-bike. Very small nice looking motors, can barely tell bike has a motor.

### Bafang

A small planetary geared motor very similiar in size and performance to the Cute motor.

### 9-Continents (9C)

A gearless brushless motor weighing in around 15 pounds and capable of putting out serious power when over volted. A reliable and solid motor. (read our [review](https://www.electricbike.com/9c/) here)

### BionX

A sleek  system, but expensive and made from all proprietary components, making it hard to upgrade controller or battery. Comes in 250, 350, and 500 watt configurations.

### BPM hub motor

A larger geared hub motor (about same size as bmc or mac) that puts out a maximum of 500 watts.

### Golden Motor (magic pie)

A heavy DD motor capable of putting out good power when over volted.
