# Communication

## TO DO

1. Ask KU Leuven if they want to be a "technical partner" as defined on page 10-11 of the adventure regulations.

2. Individual Registration: participants are invited to promote a cause, association, school or a nonprofit. In this case, they may add ONE cause name to their own. Ex.: “Marc Dunand - Red Cross”.

3.  Participants are free to communicate on their personal space on the website www.thesuntrip.com or on their personal website, as long as their space on the site www.thesuntrip.com can be automatically and completely syndicated (by RSS or other).
